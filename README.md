# botDiscordJava

School project where we had to make a discord bot in Java. That code is here to create a *Bottix* clone, not control it. But you can install *Bottix* on your server to test it.

## Installation

Add my Bot *Bottix* to your server [Ajouter *Bottix*](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=694145758462476338&scope=bot) 

## Usage

After adding the bot to the server, you can type this command to see all the instructions.\n
Be careful, if the server is not launched, in this case *Bottix* will be offline.
